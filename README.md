## Getting Started 🚀

_You only need to clone the project in a local environment. To execute you must run the command **'ng serve'**._

See **Deployment** for how to deploy the project.

_You must have installed:_

_- Angular CLI: Run this command for install Angular CLI `npm install -g @angular/cli`_

### Installing 🔧

_These are the next steps to be able to execute the project in your local environment:_

_You can use Git or Github to clone the project in a local environment. If you use Github you must click on the button that says 'Code' and then on 'Download Zip'. But if you use Git you can use the following command:_

```
git clone https://github.com/jedahee/JointCounter.git)
```

_We enter inside the root directory with:_

cd /your/path/JointCounter
```

_Now we need to install the project dependencies by executing the command:_

```
ng serve
```

_Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files._


## Code scaffolding ☕

_Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`._

## Testing 🧪

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
